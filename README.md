This is a **Natural Resource Analysis** app . 

* The creator of this app is **Kumar Vatsal**.
* The data used for this app is the `natural_resources` data that is downloaded from Our World in Data [HERE](https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/natural-resources)

The RShiny app focuses on providing comprehensive insights into global fossil fuel production, consumption, and trade dynamics, empowering stakeholders with valuable information for strategic decision-making.

Key features include:

**📊 Country-wise Fossil Fuel Production:** I map out which countries produce specific types of fossil fuels, offering clarity on geographical distribution and resource allocation.

**📈 Production Trends Analysis:** By tracking production trends over time, the app enable users to discern evolving patterns in fossil fuel extraction, facilitating informed forecasting and policy formulation.

**🔍 Reserve Estimations:** Gain insights into the estimated total reserves of various fossil fuels worldwide, aiding in long-term resource management and investment planning.

**📉 Consumption Patterns:** The app analyze consumption trends across different countries, providing a nuanced understanding of energy demands and usage dynamics.

**🌐 Population Correlation:** Through population data visualization, we explore potential correlations between population growth and fossil fuel consumption, contributing to discussions on sustainability and demographic influences.


My goal is to provide a user-friendly platform that synthesizes complex data into actionable insights, facilitating informed decision-making in the energy sector and beyond.
